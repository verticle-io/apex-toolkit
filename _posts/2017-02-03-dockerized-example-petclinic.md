title: "Using APEX with Elasticsearch - Dockerized Demo"
date: 2017-02-03

In the last release we introduced apexbeat - a community beat for Elasticsearch to link Java applications via APEX.
We added a new example showcasing the popular Spring Petclinic application.

This fully contained demo can be run locally with docker-compose and allows playing with APEX instructions and Kibana visualizations.
